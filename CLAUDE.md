| `/quickstart` | 10-minute guided setup experience |
| `/ingest` | Process raw content into knowledge graph |
| `/graph-health` | Check system health and get recommendations |

### Skills

## Quick Start

Run `/quickstart` to begin. The guide will:

4. Set up taxonomy and ontology rules
5. Process your first piece of content
6. Verify it works

Total time: ~10 minutes

## How Context OS Works

### Two-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1: Atomic Knowledge** (knowledge_base/)
- Individual reusable concepts
- Structured with frontmatter metadata
- Linked via [[wiki-links]]

**Layer 2: Operational Docs** (00_foundation/)
- Strategic documents that compose Layer 1
- Positioning, messaging, processes
- Reference atomic concepts, don't redefine them

### Key Files

- `CLAUDE.md` - Navigation guide (AI reads this first)
- `taxonomy.yaml` - Blessed tags for your domain
- `ontology.yaml` - How concepts relate to each other

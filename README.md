# GTM Context OS Quickstart

**Build a context operating system where your AI never forgets what you've taught it.**

## The Problem

Every new AI session starts from scratch. You re-explain your business, re-teach your preferences, re-provide context. Knowledge doesn't compound.

## The Solution

A Context OS structures your knowledge so AI:
- Remembers everything across sessions
- Links concepts together (graph, not files)
- Compounds intelligence over time

## Get Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacob-dietle/gtm-context-os-quickstart.git
cd gtm-context-os-quickstart
```

Open in Cursor (or any editor with Claude Code), then run:

```
/quickstart
```

In 10 minutes you'll have:
- Structured knowledge base
- Navigation guide for AI
- Your first processed content
- Working system that persists

## What's Included

### Commands
- `/quickstart` - Guided setup (10 min)
- `/ingest` - Process content into knowledge
- `/graph-health` - Check system health

### Templates
- CLAUDE.md starter
- Taxonomy configuration
- Ontology rules
- Knowledge node format

### Skill
- `context-os-basics` - Foundation patterns

## How It Works

**Two Layers:**

1. **Atomic Knowledge** (knowledge_base/)
   - Individual concepts with metadata
   - Linked via [[wiki-links]]
   - Lifecycle: emergent → validated → canonical

2. **Operational Docs** (00_foundation/)
   - Strategic documents that compose atomic concepts
   - Positioning, messaging, processes

**Constitutional Docs:**
- `taxonomy.yaml` - Your blessed tags
- `ontology.yaml` - How concepts relate

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI or Cursor with Claude Code extension
- Claude Pro subscription ($20/month)

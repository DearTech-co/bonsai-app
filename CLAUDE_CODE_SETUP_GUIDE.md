# Claude Code Setup Guide

**Copy this entire document into ChatGPT, Claude, or Cursor's AI chat to get guided help with setup.**

## FOR AI ASSISTANTS

You are helping a user set up Claude Code in Cursor IDE. Follow this protocol:

**STEP 1 - Determine their situation:**
1. What operating system? (Windows or Mac)
2. What's already installed? Have them run the prerequisite checks below
3. Do they have Claude Pro subscription ($20/month)?

**STEP 2 - Guide them through ONLY the steps they need:**
- Skip to the relevant platform section (Windows or Mac)
- Skip installation steps for tools they already have
- Use the "Common Steps" section once platform-specific setup is done

**STEP 3 - Watch for these common issues:**
- **Invisible password**: ALWAYS warn before any password prompt
- **Terminal restart needed**: After ANY install, terminal must be closed/reopened
- **"command not found"**: Usually means terminal restart needed
- **Claude auth fails**: Usually wrong subscription tier (need Pro, not Free)

---

## Quick Start: What's Your Situation?

**Tell your AI assistant:**
1. **What computer?** Windows or Mac?
2. **Run these checks** in a terminal and share results:
   ```
   git --version
   gh --version
   ```
3. **Do you have Claude Pro?** ($20/month at claude.ai, NOT free tier)

---

## Prerequisite Check Table

Run each command. If it shows a version number, you can skip that installation step.

| Command | Example Success Output | If Missing, Install |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `git --version` | `git version 2.39.0` | Git (Step 2) |
| `gh --version` | `gh version 2.40.1` | GitHub CLI (Step 3-4) |
| `brew --version` (Mac only) | `Homebrew 4.1.0` | Homebrew (Mac Step 2) |

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Two Things That Confuse Everyone

### 1. Invisible Password Typing

When the terminal asks for your password:
- **YOUR TYPING WILL NOT SHOW ON SCREEN**
- No dots, no asterisks, no cursor movement - NOTHING
- This is normal security behavior, not a bug
- **Just type your password and press Enter**

This trips up almost everyone. The password IS being entered even though you see nothing.

### 2. Terminal Restart Rule

After installing ANY tool (Git, GitHub CLI, Homebrew):
1. Type `exit` and press Enter
2. Close the terminal panel
3. Open a NEW terminal (Terminal → New Terminal)

The new terminal "sees" newly installed tools. The old one doesn't.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you need:

- [ ] **Admin access** to your computer (can install software)
- [ ] **GitHub account** - create free at github.com if needed
- [ ] **Claude Pro subscription** - $20/month at claude.ai
  - Free tier does NOT work with Claude Code
  - Team accounts need "Standard" or "Premium" seat (not "Basic")
- [ ] **Stable internet**

---

## What's Your Platform?

# Mac Setup

Mac requires a few extra steps because developer tools aren't pre-installed.

## Step 1: Install Cursor IDE

3. Open the .dmg file from Downloads
4. **Drag** the Cursor icon into the Applications folder

## Step 2: Install Homebrew (Mac Package Manager)

Homebrew lets you install developer tools easily.

1. In Cursor, go to Terminal → New Terminal

⚠️ **PASSWORD INCOMING**: The next prompt asks for your Mac login password.
**YOUR TYPING WILL NOT SHOW ON SCREEN.** No dots, no asterisks, nothing.
This is normal. Type your password and press Enter.

4. When it says "Password:", type your Mac login password and press Enter
5. Wait for installation (5-15 minutes)
6. **IMPORTANT**: Follow any "Next steps" instructions shown at the end (usually adding Homebrew to your PATH)

---

## Step 4: Install GitHub CLI

1. In the NEW terminal, type:

# Troubleshooting

## Diagnostic Commands

**When something goes wrong, run these and share the output with your AI assistant:**

```bash
git --version
gh --version
gh auth status
```

**Interpreting results:**

| Output | Meaning | Fix |
|--------|---------|-----|
| `command not found` | Tool not installed OR terminal needs restart | Restart terminal, then install if still missing |
| Version number shows | Tool is installed correctly | Move to next step |
| `gh auth status` → "not logged in" | GitHub CLI not authenticated | Run `gh auth login` |
| `gh auth status` → "Logged in to github.com as X" | GitHub auth working | Auth is fine, issue is elsewhere |

---

## Common Issues

### "brew: command not found"
Close terminal, open new terminal, try again. If still failing, Homebrew didn't install correctly - re-run the install command.

### "gh: command not found"
Close terminal, open new terminal. If still failing on Mac, make sure Homebrew installed successfully first.

### Claude Code won't authenticate
- Verify you have Claude Pro ($20/month) or Standard/Premium team seat
- **Free tier does NOT work** - this is the most common issue
- Log out of claude.ai in browser, log back in, try again
- Close and reopen the Claude Code panel in Cursor

### "Repository not found" when cloning
- Check URL is correct (copy from GitHub website)
- Verify you have access to the repo (can you see it on github.com?)
- Run `gh auth status` - make sure it shows you're logged in

### Authentication asks for password repeatedly
The `gh auth login` flow should handle this. If Git keeps asking for username/password, run `gh auth login` again and make sure you select HTTPS and web browser authentication.

### Terminal commands don't work after install
Always close and reopen terminal after installing new tools. On Windows, you may need to restart Cursor entirely.

# What You Can Do Now

You can ask Claude Code anything about your repository:

- "What files are in the /docs folder?"
- "Summarize our brand voice guidelines"
- "Write a social post about X using our messaging"
- "Find all mentions of [competitor]"
- "What's our pricing strategy?"

Claude Code sees all your files and can read, search, and help you work with them.

# [Your Context OS Name] - Navigation Guide

**Purpose:** [One sentence description]

## What Is This?

This is your **Context Operating System** - a structured knowledge graph where:
- AI compounds intelligence over time
- Knowledge persists across sessions
- Concepts link to each other

**Philosophy:** Your context is primary. System structures and compounds it.

## How to Use This System

### Finding Information

1. **Start with synthesis docs** - Check `_synthesis/` folders first
2. **Then atomic concepts** - Read specific nodes in knowledge_base/
3. **Follow wiki-links** - [[concept-name]] links to related ideas

### Adding Information

Process raw content (transcripts, docs, notes):
"Process [file] into my knowledge base"

The system will:
- Extract concepts
- Create structured nodes
- Link to related concepts

### Checking Health

Run: /graph-health

This checks:
- Tag sprawl
- Orphan nodes
- Aging emergent concepts

---

## Quality Standards

**Every concept should have:**
- Structured frontmatter (tags, status, relationships)
- At least 3 links to related concepts
- Clear source attribution

**Evidence format:**
- [VERIFIED: source:line] - Direct evidence
- [INFERRED: logic] - Deduced from evidence
- [UNVERIFIABLE] - Cannot confirm

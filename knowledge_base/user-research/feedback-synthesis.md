# Feedback Synthesis

Framework for collecting, organizing, and acting on user feedback from interviews, support requests, and analytics.

## Feedback Sources

### Primary Sources

| Source | Type | Frequency | Owner |
|--------|------|-----------|-------|
| User interviews | Qualitative | Monthly | Product |
| Support tickets | Mixed | Continuous | Support |
| App reviews | Qualitative | Continuous | Product |
| Feature requests | Qualitative | Continuous | Product |
| Analytics events | Quantitative | Continuous | Engineering |

### Secondary Sources

- Bonsai club forums and Facebook groups
- Competitor reviews
- Industry publications
- Social media mentions

## Feedback Categories

### Feature Requests

Requests for new functionality.

| Priority | Request | Persona | Count | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| High | - | - | - | - |
| Medium | - | - | - | - |
| Low | - | - | - | - |

### Pain Points

Problems users experience.

| Severity | Pain Point | Persona | Count | Resolution |
|----------|------------|---------|-------|------------|
| Critical | - | - | - | - |
| Major | - | - | - | - |
| Minor | - | - | - | - |

### Positive Feedback

What users love.

| Feature | Quote | Persona | Count |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Synthesis Process

### Step 1: Collect

- Record all feedback in raw form
- Tag by source and date
- Note participant/user context

### Step 2: Categorize

- Assign to feedback category (request, pain point, positive)
- Map to persona type
- Tag with relevant features/topics

### Step 3: Quantify

- Count frequency of similar feedback
- Calculate impact (users affected x severity)
- Prioritize by impact score

### Step 4: Analyze

- Identify patterns across personas
- Look for root causes
- Connect to existing roadmap items

### Step 5: Act

- Create/update product backlog items
- Share insights with team
- Close the loop with users when changes ship

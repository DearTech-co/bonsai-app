# Pricing Strategy

Revenue model and monetization approach for the Bonsai marketplace.

## Current State

[DECIDED: MVP launches free to build user base]

No fees during initial launch phase to:
- Attract early adopters
- Build critical mass of listings
- Gather feedback on willingness to pay

## Revenue Model Options

### 1. Transaction Fees
- Percentage of sale price (e.g., 5-10%)
- Pros: Aligned with seller success
- Cons: Difficult to enforce without payment integration

### 2. Listing Fees
- Per-listing fee or monthly limit
- Pros: Simple, predictable
- Cons: May discourage listings

### 3. Subscription Tiers
- Free tier with limits
- Premium tier with benefits
- Pros: Recurring revenue
- Cons: Complexity

### 4. Featured Listings
- Pay to boost visibility
- Pros: Optional, value-add
- Cons: May feel unfair

### 5. Business Accounts
- Monthly fee for nurseries/shops
- Enhanced features, verification badge
- Pros: B2B revenue stream
- Cons: Smaller market

## Recommended Approach

[PROPOSED: Freemium with featured listings]

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Completely free
**Phase 2:** Introduce featured listings (optional paid promotion)
**Phase 3:** Business account subscriptions
**Phase 4:** Consider transaction fees with payment integration

## Pricing Research Needed

- [OPEN] What do similar marketplaces charge?
- [OPEN] Willingness to pay survey
- [OPEN] Price sensitivity by seller type

## South Africa Considerations

- ZAR currency fluctuations
- Payment gateway availability
- Economic sensitivity of hobby market
